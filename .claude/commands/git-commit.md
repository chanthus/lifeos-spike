Git commit all changes that currently exist in the working directory.

**Instructions**:

- Create a concise, descriptive commit message (max 100 characters)
- The message should convey the "why" not the "what". "what" can be inferred from the changes.
- Commit the changes
- Do NOT proactively commit any subsequent changes

**IMPORTANT**:

- Don't just relay on the current conversation. Read all the uncommitted changes and then come up with a commit message.
- Review all staged and unstaged changes carefully
- This command is ONLY for committing existing changes right now
- Do NOT automatically commit changes in future messages or conversations
- After running this command, return to normal behavior
- Future changes should only be committed when the user explicitly runs this command again
- look for git-commit-discipline skill
